Wearable Embedded Camera Definition

Introduction
Wearable embedded camera allows a user to covertly record first person POV with by embedding the
system into an accessory. The footage can be viewed in real time on a handheld, remote display.
It can be inconvenient or unsafe to record with a device in hand. Covert recording triggers
legal and ethical privacy concerns.
