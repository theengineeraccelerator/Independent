Wearable Embedded Camera Definition

Introduction
It can be inconvenient or unsafe to record with a device in your hands. This system allows a user
to covertly record by sewing the system into an accessory. The footage can be viewed on a handheld,
remote display. Covert recording triggers legal and ethical privacy concerns.

Detailed Behavior
   Initial State: Standby
       Power sent to system for charging or otherwise
            1. Devices charges but processor does not initialize.
   Initial State: Normal
       Power button pressed device initializes and waits for input.
            1. Device uses normal battery capacity in this state.
   Initial State: Idle
       Device is powered for over 5 minutes but has not been engaged for recording.
            1. Device uses less battery capacity in this state.
   Initial State: Recording
      Device is recording and storing in RAM and checking storage capacity.
           1. If capacity is hit the system automatically stops recording and stores.
           2. Else, devices stops recording when user presses button.
   Initial State: Storing
      System stores what has been recorded.
   Initial State: Shutdown
          1. User presses and holds power button to shut down the system.
          2. System checks and to see if anything should be stored.
