Detailed Behavior
   State: Initial State
       Arduino Uno power on
      	   # Blink State indicator three times to confirm operational power	
          # Play one tone for one second to confirm functionality of speaker
          # Check state status for operational state
          # Change state indicator light to comply with the state
		# If manual state indicator is chosen, GOTO Manual Frequency Signal Driven State
		# If manual state indicator is not chosen, GOTO  idle state

   State: Idle State 
       Micro Controller is set to Idle
        
	State switch changes
		GOTO Manual Frequency Signal Driven State

	Instruction are receved
		GOTO Arduino Frequency Signal Driven State

   State: Arduino Frequency Signal Driven State
       Input is received
		# PWM out to drive speaker based on observed input from Arduino
		# reset Idle timer
	
	Idle Timer times out
		GOTO Idle State

	State switch changes
		GOTO Manual Frequency Signal Driven State
                
   State: Manual Frequency Signal Driven State
    	State switch changes
		# Turn of PWM
		# GOTO Idle State

   State: Eq switch off
	The State Switch has been deactivated
	    # Signal is forwarded from the from Chebyshev Low Pass filter to Attenuator.

   State: Eq switch on
	The State Switch has been activated
	    # Signal is forwarded from the from Chebyshev Low Pass filter to the 3 band eq. then the Attenuator.
	    	# Signal is altered based on the EQ. settings.

   State: Off 
       Unplugged from Arduino
            # Nothing happens
