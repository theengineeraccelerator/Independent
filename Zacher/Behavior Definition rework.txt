Detailed Behavior
Input State
   State: Initial State
       Arduino Uno power on
      	   # Blink State indicator three times to confirm operational power	
          # Play one tone for one second to confirm functionality of speaker
          # Check state status for operational state
          # Change state indicator light to comply with the state
	   # If manual state indicator is chosen, 
		GOTO Manual Frequency Signal Driven State
	   # If manual state indicator is not chosen
		 GOTO  idle state

   State: Idle State 
       Event: Micro Controller is set to Idle
        
	Event:State switch changes
		GOTO Manual Frequency Signal Driven State

	Event:Instruction are received
		GOTO Arduino Frequency Signal Driven State

   State: Arduino Frequency Signal Driven State
       Event:Input is received
		# PWM out to drive speaker based on observed input from Arduino
		# reset Idle timer
	
	Event:Idle Timer times out
		GOTO Idle State

	Event:State switch changes
		GOTO Manual Frequency Signal Driven State
                
   State: Manual Frequency Signal Driven State
    	Event:State switch changes
		# Turn of PWM
		# GOTO Idle State

Output States
   State: Eq switch off
	Event:The State Switch has been deactivated
	    # Signal is forwarded from the from Chebyshev Low Pass filter to Attenuator.

   State: Eq switch on
	Event:The State Switch has been activated
	    # Signal is forwarded from the from Chebyshev Low Pass filter to the 3 band eq. then the Attenuator.
	    	# Signal is altered based on the EQ. settings.

   State: Off 
       Unplugged from Arduino
            # Nothing happens
